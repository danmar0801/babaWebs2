                "We worked with Fares on a major kitchen and main level remodel. 
                Fares was very responsive and accommodating to our questions during the planning process.
                We also hired our own designer, who Fares has never worked with, but collaborated with extremely well.
                Our project actually finished on schedule, with no delays."
